# joinmarket-rs

A full Rust rewrite of [JoinMarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver), developed in phases. Each JoinMarket tool is reimplemented as its own statically-linked binary, sharing common protocol logic via the `joinmarket-core` library crate.

## Why rewrite in Rust?

JoinMarket is hard to install. The Python toolchain, `pip`, virtualenvs, and a growing list of native dependencies make it inaccessible for non-technical operators — precisely the people most needed to run infrastructure like directory nodes.

The directory node in particular has had reliability and stability issues in the Python implementation: memory growth under load, unhandled exceptions crashing the process, and difficulty deploying it as a hardened system service.

A Rust rewrite addresses both problems:

- **Single statically-linked binary** — no Python, no pip, no virtualenv. Download and run.
- **Memory-safe and crash-resistant** — no uncaught exceptions, predictable memory use
- **Designed for scale** — 100k+ concurrent peer connections on a single server
- **Easy to package** — one file, no runtime dependencies, works on any modern Linux

Programs ship as pre-built static binaries for Linux (x86\_64 and aarch64), macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), and Windows (x86\_64) as well as source. Building from source requires only `rustup` — no system libraries, no C toolchain beyond what Rust itself needs.

## Programs in this suite

| Program | Crate | Description | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Directory node | [`joinmarket-dn`](#joinmarket-dn--directory-node) | Rendezvous server for maker/taker peer discovery | Alpha |

Additional tools (yield generator, coinjoin client, wallet) will follow in later phases as the core library matures.

---

## joinmarket-dn — Directory node

The first program in the suite. A pure-Rust reimplementation of `start-dn.py`.

The Python directory node (`start-dn.py`) has been the most operationally painful part of running JoinMarket infrastructure. It requires a full Python environment, leaks memory under sustained load, and crashes on unexpected input from peers. Running it reliably as a system service requires considerable babysitting.

`joinmarket-dn` replaces it with a single binary: drop it on a server, point it at a Tor hidden service directory, and run it under systemd. It handles 100k+ concurrent peer connections and is fully wire-compatible with existing Python JoinMarket clients.

The directory node is a lightweight rendezvous server for the JoinMarket coinjoin protocol:

- Accepts inbound connections from JoinMarket maker and taker peers over Tor
- Performs a JSON handshake and maintains a nick → onion registry
- Relays public messages (`!ann`, `!orderbook`) by broadcast to all connected peers
- Routes private messages by returning the target peer's onion address (peers then connect directly — the directory does **not** relay private content)
- Responds to `!getpeers` with the full maker list (or a bond-weighted sample at scale)
- Broadcasts an operator MOTD during handshake
- Requires no Bitcoin node, no wallet, no blockchain access

## Building

**Prerequisites:** Rust 1.75+ (stable). Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs).

```bash
# Clone and build all crates
git clone https://github.com/takinbrrrr/joinmarket-rs
cd joinmarket-rs
cargo build --release

# The binary is at:
./target/release/joinmarket-dn
```

### Cargo features

Features are defined on the `joinmarket-tor` crate and are passed through to the binary via `--features`.

| Feature | Crate | What it enables | Default |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------|
| `tordaemon` | `joinmarket-tor` | C Tor daemon backend (`CTorProvider`). Requires the `tor` binary on the host. PoW defence is configured externally via C Tor (requires a `tor` build with `--enable-gpl`); the directory node has no visibility into whether PoW is active. | **On** |
| `arti` | `joinmarket-tor` | Arti embedded Tor backend (`ArtiTorProvider`). No external `tor` binary needed. Pulls in LGPL `equix`/`hashx` crates for PoW; activated at runtime with `--pow`. | Off |

**Default build (C Tor daemon backend):**

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The `tordaemon` feature is on by default. Configure your existing C Tor hidden service directory in `joinmarket.cfg` and run the binary.

**Build with the Arti embedded backend:**

```bash
cargo build --release \
  --no-default-features \
  --features joinmarket-dn/arti
```

Then activate PoW at runtime with `--pow`:

```bash
joinmarket-dn --pow "My PoW-protected directory node"
```

> **PoW licensing note:** The `arti` feature pulls in the `equix` and `hashx` crates,
> which are LGPL-licensed. Binaries linked against them are LGPL-encumbered.
>
> The `tordaemon` feature supports PoW via C Tor's built-in defence, which requires a
> `tor` binary compiled with `--enable-gpl`. Without it, the node starts without
> Tor-level DoS protection.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests across the workspace
cargo test --workspace

# Run tests for a specific crate
cargo test -p joinmarket-core
cargo test -p joinmarket-dn

# Run a specific test
cargo test -p joinmarket-core onion::tests::test_valid_v3_address
```

There are currently **106 tests** across the workspace:

| Crate | Tests |
|-------|-------|
| `joinmarket-core` | 68 (nick, onion, message, handshake, crypto, fidelity bond, config) |
| `joinmarket-dn` | 22 unit + 16 integration (router, sybil guard, bond registry, admission control, end-to-end) |

## Running

```
joinmarket-dn [OPTIONS] [OPERATOR_MESSAGE]

Options:
  --datadir <PATH>            Data directory [default: ~/.joinmarket].
                              Must contain joinmarket.cfg with [MESSAGING:onion]
                              and [BLOCKCHAIN] sections.
  --metrics-bind <ADDR>       Prometheus metrics bind address [default: 127.0.0.1:9090]
  --pow                       Enable Tor PoW DoS defence (requires a binary built
                              with --features arti)
                              [only available when built with the `arti` feature]

Network, port, hidden service directory, and other settings are read from
joinmarket.cfg (located in the data directory). If no config file exists,
a default one is created and the process exits for you to review it.

Arguments:
  [OPERATOR_MESSAGE]          Optional operator message appended to the MOTD
```

### Basic example

```bash
joinmarket-dn "Welcome to my directory node"
```

### Custom data directory

```bash
joinmarket-dn --datadir /var/lib/joinmarket "My directory node"
```

### With PoW (Arti build only)

```bash
joinmarket-dn --pow "My PoW-protected directory node"
```

### Log level

Set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to control verbosity:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug joinmarket-dn
RUST_LOG=joinmarket_dn=trace,joinmarket_core=info joinmarket-dn
```

## DoS defence layers

The directory node implements five layers of defence against abuse:

| Layer | Mechanism | Default |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Tor PoW (Equi-X puzzles) | Off — `--pow` enables it with the `arti` backend; with `tordaemon`, PoW is configured externally via C Tor |
| 2 | Connection rate limit: 3 connections/minute per onion | Always on |
| 3 | Sybil guard: one active nick per onion address | Always on |
| 4 | Fidelity bond UTXO deduplication | Always on |
| 5 | Maker registration throttle: 60 new makers/minute, 100k cap | Always on |

**PoW note:** `--pow` is only available with the `arti` backend and activates Equi-X PoW puzzles at runtime. With the `tordaemon` backend, PoW is configured externally through C Tor itself (requires a `tor` binary compiled with `--enable-gpl`); the directory node has no way to detect whether C Tor has PoW enabled.

## Peer routing

| Message | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| `!ann`, `!orderbook` | Broadcast to all connected peers |
| `!getpeers` | Return full maker list (≤20k) or bond-weighted sample (>20k) |
| `!fill <nick> ...` | Look up target nick's onion address and return it to the sender; sender connects directly |
| `!ping` | Reply `!pong` |
| `!disconnect` | Close connection cleanly |

## Memory target

Designed for **100k concurrent peers** on a single server:

| Resource | Per peer | 100k total |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Tokio task stack | ~6 KB | ~600 MB |
| Read/write buffers (4 KB each) | 8 KB | ~800 MB |
| PeerMeta in DashMap | ~128 B | ~13 MB |
| Nick index entry | ~200 B | ~20 MB |
| **Total** | **~14 KB** | **~1.4 GB** |
